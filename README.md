## DESCRIPTION

This project was done on ubuntu 20.04 LTS. It is a team project.


### SORTING ALOGORITHM

In this project we worked on 13 different sortiong algorithms:
1. Bubble Sort: bubble_sort function.
2. Insertion Sort: insertion_sort_list function.
3. Selection Sort: selection_sort function.
4. Quick Sort (Lomuto Partition Scheme): quick_sort function.
5. Merge Sort: merge_sort function.
6. Counting Sort: counting_sort function.
7. Radix Sort: radix_sort function.
8. Heap Sort: heap_sort function.
9. Bitonic Sort: bitonic_sort function.
10. Quick Sort (Hoare Partition Scheme): quick_sort_hoare function.
11. Cocktail shaker sort
12. Shell Sort

- We also attempted the to sort a deck of cards.

The tasked solved in this team projects are to help better understand the implementation of the various sorting algorithms.
